# Functions


# We have a function that outputs "Welcome, user" as it is called. We want to make it more personalized, so redesign the given function so that it will take the given input as the name of the user and output the welcome message with it.

# Sample Input
# Tommy

# Sample Output
# Welcome, Tommy


def welcome_message():
	#redesign this function
	name = input()
	print("Welcome, "+ name)

welcome_message()



# Function Arguments


# You are given a program with two inputs: one as password and the second one as password repeat. Complete and call the given function to output "Correct" if password and repeat are equal, and output "Wrong", if they are not.

# Sample Input
# nfs1598
# nfs1598

# Sample Output
# Correct

password = input()
repeat = input()

def validate(text1, text2):
	#your code goes here
	if(password == repeat):
		print('Correct')
	else:
		print('Wrong')

validate(password,repeat)
	
 
# Returning from Functions


# We are creating our own social network application and need to have a hashtag generator program.
# Complete the program to output the input text starting with the hashtag (#).
# Also, if the user entered several words, the program should delete the spaces between them.

# Sample Input
# code sleep eat repeat

# Sample Output
# #codesleepeatrepeat


s = input()

def hashtagGen(text):
	#your code goes here
	
	return text.replace(" ", "")

print("#" + hashtagGen(s))


# Modules


# Two friends want to play backgammon, but have lost the dice.
# Create a program to replace the dice. When the program is run, it should roll the dice and output the result of each die.

# Hint
# Use random.randint() function to generate random values in the range of 1 to 6 for each dice.


import random
random.seed(int(input())) #please don't touch this lane

#generate the random values for every dice
dice1 = random.randint(1,6)
dice2 = random.randint(1,6)

print(dice1)
print(dice2)


# Celsius to Fahrenheit


# You are making a Celsius to Fahrenheit converter.
# Write a function to take the Celsius value as an argument and return the corresponding Fahrenheit value.

# Sample Input
# 36

# Sample Output
# 96.8


celsius = int(input())

def conv(c):
    #your code goes here
    return 9/5 * celsius + 32
    

    

fahrenheit = conv(celsius)
print(fahrenheit)
