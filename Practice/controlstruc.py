# if Statements


# Write a program that checks if the water is boiling.
# Take the integer temperature in Celsius as input and output "Boiling" if the temperature is above or equal to 100.

# Sample Input
# 105

# Sample Output
# Boiling

temp = int(input())
# your code goes here
if (temp >= 100):
    print('Boiling')



# else Statement


# Write a program to control entrance to a club.
# Only people who are 18 or older are allowed to enter the club.
# The given program takes the age and the name of the person who tries to enter. Complete the program to output "Welcome" followed by the name of the person if they are allowed to enter the club, and "Sorry" if they are younger than the allowed age.

# Sample Input
# 24
# James

# Sample Output
# Welcome James

age = int(input())
name = input()
# your code goes here


if(age >= 18):
    
    print('Welcome '+name)

# Boolean Logic


# The comfortable relative humidity for humans is between 40% and 60%.
# The given program takes the percent of humidity as input.

# Task
# Complete the code to output "norm" if the taken percent of humidity is in the range of 40 and 60 inclusive.
# Don't output anything otherwise.

# Sample Input
# 45

# Sample Output
# norm

humidity = int(input())
#your code goes here

if (humidity >= 40 and humidity <= 60):

# Chaining Multiple Conditions


# Using an ATM, customers can access their bank deposits or credit accounts to do a variety of financial transactions.
# You serve ATMs that accept only Visa and Amex bank cards.
# The given program takes the type of a bank card as input.

# Task
# Complete the program to output "accepted" if the card is Visa or Amex.
# Don't output anything otherwise.

# Sample Input
# Amex

# Sample Output
# accepted

type = input()
#your code goes here


if(type == 'Visa' or type == 'Amex'):
    print('accepted')
    
    
    
# Lists


# Imagine a vending machine that sells fruits. Each fruit has its own number, starting from 0.
# Write a program for the vending machine, which will take n number as input from the customer and return the fruit with that index.
# fruits = ["apple", "cherry", "banana", "kiwi", "lemon", "pear", "peach", "avocado"] 
# PY
# If n< 0 or n>7 (the index of last fruit ), the program outputs "Wrong number".

# Sample Input:
# 2

# Sample Output:
# banana

fruits = ["apple", "cherry", "banana", "kiwi", "lemon", "pear", "peach", "avocado"]
num = int(input())
#your code goes here

if(num < 0 or num > 7):

# while Loops


# You have a magic box that doubles the count of items you put, in every day.
# The given program takes the initial count of the items and the number of days as input.

# Task
# Write a program to calculate and output items' count on the last day.

# Sample Input
# 3
# 2

# Sample Output
# 12

# Explanation
# Day 1: 6 (3*2)
# Day 2: 12 (6*2)


items = int(input())
days = int(input())
#your code goes here


while days > 0:
    items *= 2

# for Loops


# for loops allow you to easily iterate through lists.

# Given a list of numbers, output their sum.

# Sample Input
# 1 3 7 5

# Sample Output
# 16

list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

sum = 0
#your code goes here



# Range


# You are making a date picker for a website and need to output all the years in a given period.
# Write a program that takes two integers as input and outputs the range of numbers between the two inputs as a list.
# The output sequence should start with the first input number and end with the second input number, without including it.

# Sample Input
# 2005
# 2011

# Sample Output
# [2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010]



a = int(input())
b = int(input())
#your code goes here


k = list(range(a,b))
print(k)




# FizzBuzz


# FizzBuzz is a well known programming assignment, asked during interviews.

# The given code solves the FizzBuzz problem and uses the words "Solo" and "Learn" instead of "Fizz" and "Buzz".
# It takes an input n and outputs the numbers from 1 to n.
# For each multiple of 3, print "Solo" instead of the number.
# For each multiple of 5, prints "Learn" instead of the number.
# For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, output "SoloLearn".

# You need to change the code to skip the even numbers, so that the logic only applies to odd numbers in the range.


n = int(input())

for x in range(1, n, 2):
    if x % 3 == 0 and x % 5 == 0:
        print("SoloLearn")
    elif x % 3 == 0:
        print("Solo")
    elif x % 5 == 0:
        print("Learn")
    else:
